iBot Club Deputy Coordinator Tenure Plan (Dec 2025 - Apr 2026)
I. Program Overview and Key Metrics
The Deputy Coordinator (DC) Tenure Plan is an intensive, five-month program designed to transform 24 selected individuals into versatile technical leaders across core robotics domains. The objective is to build strong foundational and advanced skills necessary for collaborative project execution. The 24 DCs will be divided into 6 coordinator-led groups, ensuring personalized mentorship and group accountability. The program runs from December 2025 to April 2026, starting with a critical 45-day training period.

Key Metrics:

Total Deputy Coordinators: 24

Coordinator Groups: 6 (4 DCs per group)

Total Training Days (Phase I): 45 (Dec 1, 2025, to Jan 15, 2026)

Project Phase: 2 Major Mini-Projects

Final Goal: Robotics Competition (April 2026)

II. Comprehensive Curriculum (The Three Verticals)
The curriculum is divided into three parallel tracks, mixing theoretical knowledge with hands-on application, ensuring every DC develops a strong, multidisciplinary skill set.

Electronics Track
This vertical focuses on fundamental circuit design, control, and hardware interfacing.

Circuit Design & Simulation: Training in Wokwi and Tinkercad for virtual prototyping.

Hands-on Robotics: Practical work with 2-Wheel Drive Kits and implementing basic Bluetooth control systems.

Interfacing: Labs covering the use and reading of basic sensors (e.g., ultrasonic).

Software Track (New Focus: Python, Data & Vision)
This critical track balances beginner accessibility with advanced competitive programming skills.

Beginner Programming: Python fundamentals, transitioning into practical data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy.

Applied Vision: Introduction to OpenCV for computer vision and image processing relevant to robotic systems.

Core C++ & Algorithms: Deep dive into C++, focusing on Graph Theory and solving problems on GeeksforGeeks. This culminates in implementing Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms.

CLI Proficiency: Essential Linux commands and mandatory security exercises via OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 1-20).

Mechanical Track
This track covers the necessary skills for designing and fabricating robotic components and systems.

CAD Proficiency: Comprehensive training in Fusion 360, starting with basic sketching and part modeling.

System Assembly: Learning component assembly, joint configuration, and integration.

Advanced Concept: Designing large, complex systems, such as a conceptual engine.

III. Program Timeline and Phases
The tenure is structured into four distinct phases, ensuring a smooth transition from learning to application.

Phase

Duration

Dates

Primary Objective

I. Training

45 Days (18 Sessions)

Dec 1, 2025 – Jan 15, 2026

Core curriculum completion and skill acquisition.

II. Catch-up/Buffer

15 Days

Jan 16 – Jan 31, 2026

Reinforce weak areas, utilize 15-day buffer time, and finalize attendance evaluation.

III. Projects

2 Months

Feb 1 – Mar 31, 2026

Execution of 2 Major Mini-Projects (application of all learned skills).

Culmination

1 Month

April 2026

Final Club Robotics Competition.

Live Session Schedule:

Sessions are conducted via Google Meet every 4 days.

The 18 required sessions are covered, with each of the 6 Coordinators leading approximately 4-5 sessions.

Every live session is followed by a mandatory task/assignment with a 1-week deadline.

IV. Evaluation and Accountability
The program features strict checkpoints to ensure commitment and meritocracy.

Minimum Attendance Requirement: Any DC with a cumulative attendance less than 75% by the January 15, 2026 evaluation checkpoint will be removed from the training program.

Attendance Weighting: Weekly attendance is calculated based on a balanced metric:

50% Weightage: Attendance during the live Google Meet session.

50% Weightage: Submission of the mandatory assignment for that cycle.

Performance Leaderboard: A points-based leaderboard will track performance across assignments and session participation. The ranking as of January 15, 2026, will determine the weightage, roles, and responsibilities of DCs during the subsequent Project Phase.
